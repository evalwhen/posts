You've reached JianFeng Hu's personal website. Welcome!

I acquired programming skills through self-study. I commenced learning programming in 2016.
SICP is my first programming book, i loved it, enjoy reading it, i learned so much from SICP.

In my free time, I enjoy coding in scheme. In this blog, I will write things about Scheme and Computation.
I will show you Scheme is alovely language. It's also a serious language, little core and
based on macro, we can implement so many common features in other mainstream languages.

I'll predominantly use English to share my think with the world, thank you.
