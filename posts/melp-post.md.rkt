Scheme is my favority programming language. I known Scheme from SICPï¼Œ

I'm a self-taught programmer from 2016. SICP is my first programming book, I loved it,
enjoy reading it, I learned so much from SICP.

Currently, I work in china, I live by building monitor system. Golang is my working language.
After work, I like think with scheme, write with scheme, play with scheme. 

In this blog, I will write things about Scheme and Computation. I will show you Scheme is a
lovely language, if you like think something. It's also a serious language, little core and
on top it with macro, you can implement so many features in other mainstream languages.

I use English to write, beacause I want to share my think with world, not just China where I
live, thank you.
